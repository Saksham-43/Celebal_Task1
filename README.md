# Iris Prediction App (Streamlit + Random Forest): 
 
This is a simple web app built using Streamlit that uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict a feature of the Iris flower dataset. You can enter values like sepal and petal measurements, and the app will predict the petal length.

**What this app does:**

* Takes user input for flower measurements.<br>
* Uses a trained Random Forest model to make a prediction.<br>
* Shows the predicted result.<br>
* Displays simple visualizations to understand the model.<br>
